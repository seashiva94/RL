# RL
A repository for practicing reinformcement learning

* cartpole.py uses openAI's gym and uses hill climbing to learn the game using reinforcement learning
* pong.py: a pong game created in python using pygame to be used for reinforcement learning
* ponr_rl.py uses deep q learning in tensorflow to beat the pong game


TODO
* use policy gradient for the pong game
* use other environments in openAI gym 
* use different RL methods
